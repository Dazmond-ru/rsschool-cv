## **About Me**
I am a beginner frontend developer.
I graduated from the Civil Engineering University and worked as a design engineer for over 5 years. I have enough experience in communicating with people, so I can easily become part of the team.
My task is to become a good specialist in the field of frontend development. I will put the maximum amount of time and effort into training.
In my free time, I meet with friends and watch movies. My hobbies are playing guitar and running long distances.

I am glad that I have the opportunity to study at RS school and improve my skills.
